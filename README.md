Just realised it is proabbly a good idea to explain this.

well, @Austech was making a game for a while and I lended a small hand, Unfortunetally work stalled due to work between both of us so it was never finsihed. Some things are there but it really is mostly incompleate.

As for the setting, No idea. Don't even ask
